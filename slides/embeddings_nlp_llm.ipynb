    "-   Typically we want that $\\mathcal{Z}$ as a continuous vector space of\n",
    "    finite dimension\n",

    "        $||\\phi(x) - \\phi(y)||$)\n",
    "-   The dimension of $\\mathcal{Z}$ may be smaller or larger than\n",
    "    $\\mathcal{X}$\n",
    "    -   If larger, typically embeddings of data $x \\in \\mu^*$ are close\n",
    "        to lower-dimensional manifold e.g., separating hyperplane in\n",
    "        $\\mathbf{R}^3$ with kernel\n",
